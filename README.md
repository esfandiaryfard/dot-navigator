# dot-navigator
This is just a simple navigator,
there is a navigator with rectangle in the left side and you can click on each rectangle to navigate to another section (or every where you wish ,you just need to change route)
There is a tooltip to tell you each click routh you where ,
there is some title for each rectangle that I commented them , you can un comment and use it if you wish to have a tag in front of each rectangle


p.s. I made it because a friend need this for a project , but if you have a comment to improve it you can share with me :)
